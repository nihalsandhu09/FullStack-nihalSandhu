### What is domain name 
```
Domain names are a key part of the Internet infrastructure. They provide a human-readable address for any web server available on the Internet.

Any Internet-connected computer can be reached through a public IP Address, either an IPv4 address (e.g. 192.0.2.172) or an IPv6 address (e.g., 2001:db8:8b73:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:1337).

Computers can handle such addresses easily, but people have a hard time finding out who is running the server or what service the website offers. IP addresses are hard to remember and might change over time.

To solve all those problems we use human-readable addresses called domain names
