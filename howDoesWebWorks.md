### How the Web works 
```
 how the web works provides a simplified view of what happens when you view a webpage in a web browser on your computer or phone.
 
 1): Clients and Servers 
 cmputers  connected to the internet are called clents and servers.

 * clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your wifi, or your phone connected to your mobile network)and we-accessing software available on those devices(usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).

 * server are computer that store webpage, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage,  a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser


 The Client and server we've descrbed above don't tell the whole story. There are many other parts involved,and we'll describe them below.

 For now , let's imagine that web is a road.On one end of the road is the client, which is like your house. On the othher end of the road is the server, which is a shop you want to buy something from.

 In addition to the client and the server, we also need to say hello to :

 * Your internet connection: Allows you to send and receive data on the web. it's basically like the street between your house and the shop.

 * TCP/IP: Transmission control Protocol and Internet Protocol are Communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet. This is like the transport mechanisms that let you place an order, go to the shop, and buy your goods. in our example, this is like a car or a bike (or however else you might get around).
