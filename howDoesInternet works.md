## how does the Internet work? 
```  
 The internet is the backbone of the web, the technical infrastructure that makes the web possible. At its most basics,the internet is a large network of computers which communicate all together . 
 
 first we need to know history of internet ? 

 how internet found 

it began in 1960s as a US-army-funded research project, then evolved into a public infrastructure in the 1980s with the support of many public univertes and private companies.the various technologies that support the internet have evolved over time, but te way it works hasn't changed that much:Internet: is a way to connect computes all togerther and ensure taht,whatever happens, they find a way to stay connected.


deeper dive 

1): A simple network 

when two computers need to communicate, you have to link them either pyhsically (usually with an Ethernet cable) or wirelessely (for example with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth systems). All modern computers can sustain any of those connections.

Such a netwrok is not limited to two computers.You can connect as many computers as you wish.but it gets complicated quickly. if you are trying to connect,say,ten computers, you need 45 cabels,with nine plugs per computer!

To solve this problem, each computer on a network is connected to a special tiny computer called a router.this router has only one job:like a signaler at a railway station, it makes sure that a message sent from a given computer arrives at the right desination computer. To send a message to computer B, computer A must send the message to the router,  which in turn forwards the message to computer B and Make sure the Message is not deliverd to computer C.

once we add a router to the system ,our network of 10 cpmputers only requires 10 cables:a single plug for each computer and a router with 10 plugs


2): A NETWORK OF NETWORKS 

SO far so good. but what about connecting hundreds, thousands, billions of computers? of courses a single router can't scale that far, But, if you read carefully, we said that a router is a computer like any other, so what keeps us from connecting two routers together? nothings , so lets do that.
